## What is this?

Eat-The-Burger is a logging application that allows a user to input a burger name which will then appear on the page under the "Burgers to be eaten" section. For further functionality, the user can then choose to "devour" the burger, which will result in the burger being placed in the "Burgers Eaten" section.

## Technologies

I normally would include links, plus a description of technologies used (if applicable).  For a major project, this is a good idea, but for something small, maybe just a link would suffice.

#### For Example:

* HTML
* CSS (bootstrap)
* JavaScript (JQuery)
* Node JS
* Express node module
* MySQL and MySQL node module
* Express HandleBars
